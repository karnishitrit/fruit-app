### about the api
the api of the fruits includes get method for product and post method for submit the application.

https://front-end-exam-dot-winky-apis.ew.r.appspot.com/docs#/

each fruit contain-
id, name, color, price, stock (amount in stock)

i recommend you to add an option to get all names of the fruits, it can allow an option to add them to the drop down and prevent hard-code in the application.
this option will make the application more generic and not depend on which fruits are in the api.

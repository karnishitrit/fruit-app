### About the API
The API of the fruits includes a get method for a product and a post method to submit the application.

Each fruit contains the following parameters-
id, name, color, price, stock (amount in stock)

I recommend you to add an option to get all names of the fruits, it could allow an option to add them to the drop down and prevent hard-coding in the application.
This option will make the application more generic and not depend on which fruits are in the api.
